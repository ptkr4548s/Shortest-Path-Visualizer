# Shortest-Path-Visualizer
Welcome to our Dijkstra's Shortest Path Visualizer project, now with an added twist! This GitHub repository introduces an engaging tool designed to dynamically visualize the shortest path algorithm using Dijkstra's algorithm, while also incorporating the challenge of navigating around obstacles or "walls." Whether you're a student, developer, or simply intrigued by the intricacies of graph algorithms, this project provides a unique and interactive learning experience.
