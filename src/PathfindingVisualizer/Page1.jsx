        At its core, pathfinding algorithm seeks to 
        find the shortest path between two points.
        This application visualizes the Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms in action,and more!

            The algorithm on this application are adapted for a 2D grid ,
            where 90 degree turns have a "cost" of 1 and movements from a node to another node 
            have a "cost" of 1.
